# TheFrenchWay
A website to learn the basics of French. 
Through this website, I intend to provide some basics of French language to the people who are interested in learning it, starting with the most used greeting phrases. 
This website is still in the developing phase. 
More information is yet to be added and the UI is also yet to be enhanced. 
The languages used are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
People with some knowledge in French can help to make this website more informative, while people good at creativity can add additional features to it in order to enhance its UI.

THANK YOU!
